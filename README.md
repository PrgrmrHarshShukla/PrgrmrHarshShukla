# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there,

My name is Harsh Shukla.

I am pursuing CS undergrad degree.

I have a keen interest in tech in general and Full Stack Development (entry door for me) in particular.



I work with the MERN Stack.

I am working on getting an in-depth understanding in order to be a language-agnostic Software Engineer.

Have a great day.

Regards,

Harsh
